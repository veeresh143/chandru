              <p><b>What is First  Information Report?</b> <br>
The First Information Report  is a very important document.&nbsp; It is the earliest record made of an  alleged offence before there is time for its particulars to be forgotten.&nbsp;  The FIR is a written document prepared by the police when they receive  information about the commission of a cognizable offence.&nbsp; It is a report  of information that reaches the police first in point of time and that is  why&nbsp;it is called as the First Information Report.&nbsp; It is generally a  complaint lodged with the police by the victim of cognizable offence or by  someone on his/her behalf.&nbsp; Anyone can complain about the offence either  orally or in writing to the police.</p>
            <p><b>What is  cognizable offence?</b> <br>
              A cognizable offence is one  in which the police may arrest a person without warrant.&nbsp; They are  authorized to start investigation into a cognizable case on their own and do  not require any orders from the court.</p>
            <p> <b>What is non  cognizable offence?</b> <br>
              A non cognizable offence is  an offence in which a police officer has no authority to arrest without  warrant.&nbsp; The police cannot investigate such offence without the court&rsquo;s  permission.</p>
            <p> <b>Who can lodge an  FIR?</b> <br>
              Anyone who knows about the  commission of a cognizable offence can file an FIR.&nbsp; It is not necessary  that only the victim of the crime should file an FIR.&nbsp; A police officer  who comes to know about a cognizable offence can file an FIR  himself/herself.&nbsp; You can file an FIR if</p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>you are the       person against whom the offence has been committed</li>
              <li>you know       yourself about an offence which has been committed</li>
              <li>you have       seen the offence being committed</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>When can the  police refuse to investigate?</b> <br>
              The police may not  investigate a complaint even if you file a FIR when</p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>the case is       not serious in nature(trivial) or it is a non cognizable offence</li>
              <li>the police       feel that there is not enough ground to investigate however, the police       must record the reason for not conducting the investigation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Why is FIR  important?</b> <br>
              An FIR&nbsp;is very important  document as it sets the process of criminal justice in motion.&nbsp; It is only  after the FIR is registered in the police station that the police can take up  investigation of the case.</p>
            <p> <b>What is the  procedure of filing an FIR?</b> <br>
              The procedure of filing an  FIR is prescribed in section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Code 1973.<br>
              When information about the  commission of a cognizable offence is given orally, the police must write it  down.</p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>It is your       right as a person giving information or making a complaint to demand that       the information recorded by the police is read over to you.</li>
              <li>Once the       information has been recorded by the police, it must be signed by the       person giving the information.</li>
              <li>You should       sign the report only after verifying that the information recorded by the       police is as per the details given by you.</li>
              <li>People who       cannot read or write must put their left thumb impression on the document       after being satisfied that it is a correct record.</li>
              <li>Always ask       for a copy of the FIR, if the police do not give it to you,&nbsp;it is       your right to get it free of cost.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>What should you  mention in the FIR?</b></p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>Your name       and address.</li>
              <li>Date, time       and location of the incident you are reporting.</li>
              <li>The true       facts of the incident as they occurred.</li>
              <li>Names and       descriptions of the persons involved in the incident.</li>
              <li>Witnesses,       if any.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>What can you do  if your FIR&nbsp;is not registered?</b> <br>
              You can meet the  Commissioner/Superintendent of the police or other higher officers.</p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>You can       send your complaint in writing and by post to the       Commissioner/Superintendent of the police. If the officer is satisfied       with your complaint, he will instruct the subordinate officers to conduct       the investigation or he will himself investigate the case.</li>
              <li>You can       file a private complaint before the court having jurisdiction.</li>
              <li>You can       also make a complaint to the State Human Rights Commission or the National       Human Rights commission if the police do nothing to enforce the law or do       it in a biased and corrupt manner.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>What happens if  I give a false complaint?</b> <br>
            Never file a false complaint  or give wrong information to the police.&nbsp; You can be prosecuted under Sec 203  of Indian Penal Code or any other relevant law for giving wrong information or  for misleading the police.</p></td>
